# Feigenbaum-Constant-
Linkage between Feigenbaum Constant and number theory

Given the equation:

- `a(n) = ∑[A008683(A159766(n))^2 * (n+1)]`

This equation corresponds to the sequence:

- **A132315**: The sum of the non-fourth powers less than or equal to `n`.

Where:

- `A159766(n)`: The `n`th term of the sequence representing the Continued Fraction Expansion of the Feigenbaum Constant.
- `A008683(x)`: The Möbius function, which maps an integer `x` to either `1`, `-1`, or `0`, based on its prime factorization.

The process is as follows:

1. **Retrieve the `n`th Term of A159766**:
   - Calculate `term = A159766(n)`

2. **Apply the Möbius Function**:
   - Apply the Möbius function to `term`: `mobius_result = A008683(term)`

3. **Square the Möbius Function Output**:
   - Square the result from the Möbius function: `squared_result = mobius_result^2`

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Multiply the squared result by `(n+1)`: `final_result = squared_result * (n+1)`

The final value, `final_result`, represents the sum of the non-fourth powers less than or equal to `n`, linking the dynamical systems (via the Feigenbaum constant) and number theory (via the Möbius function).
